Title: About me
type: list

I am a Software Engineer at FactSet.

I specialize in designing and developing data engineering pipelines using event-driven distributed serverless infrastructure. I enjoy experimenting with new technologies and comparing them with existing ones to find their practical use cases in my projects. 

I strongly believe in giving back to the community by mitigating the intergenerational knowledge gap. Designing and developing tailored solutions is how I choose to guide users to keep up with the rapidly evolving technological landscape. 

In my free time, you can find me dancing, painting, or curled up with a good book.
